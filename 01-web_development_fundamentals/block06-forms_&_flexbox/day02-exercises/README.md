# Libraries

A programming library is a big package of functions, classes and methods that solve and implement in one of the best ways possible a problem in the specific language.

A JavaScript library can be used simply by using the function `require`. Example:

```jsx
let library = require('[libraryName]')
library.function()
```

That's it! Now you can use any function available from the specified library that will greatly reduce your code size, depending on what you are implementing

## Frameworks

Frameworks are **libraries** that handles from CSS manipulation (User Interface) all the way to database management. One popular example of CSS Framework is the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)!

## CDNs

JS Libraries are in most part distributed through *Content Delivery Network*s which are basically servers spreaded around the world that are responsible for delivering those libraries content with the lowest latency possible.

## What Makes a Good Library?

- **Documentation:** Easy to search and understandable;
- **Flexible:** Appliable over multiple cases, not for only one template situation;
- **Clean Code:** The code inside the library must be clean and optimized for great performance;
- **Active Community**: A lot of opened and solved threads on stackoverflow & github;
- **Forks & Stars:** If the library is available on GitHub, these numbers indicate community support and the number of devs supporting the project.

# Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a very popular example of framework with inner libraries in CSS & JS.

## CSS Classes & JS Functions

Bootstrap contains a lot of **pre-built** classes into it. Ex:

```html
<div class="container"> <!-- Class container ->
<input type="text" class="form-control"> <!-- Class form-control ->

<!-- These classes are built into the bootstrap.css file ->
```

All of this can be found and explored through the Docs! [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/)
