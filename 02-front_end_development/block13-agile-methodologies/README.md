# Block 13: Agile Methodologies

## Motivation

The agile methodologies were created to **fill the gap** between the **client's requirements** and what is the **result** of it to the **client's final expectation** of the developed software.

## Principles

1. Individuals & Interactions > Processes & Tools
2. Software Working > Abrangent Documentation
3. Colaboration with Client > Contract Negotiation
4. Adaptability to Changes > Following a Plan

### Minor Developing Cycles

Instead of developing the **system as a whole**, implement and demonstrate to the client **feature by feature**. **Receive the feedbacks** and **Adapt** the code based on the client's feedback.

## Frameworks

Frameworks were developed to adapt the Agile in a way that it fulfills its purpose, keeping it fast and easier to implement in real life software engineering.

### Scrum

The Scrum divides the team in three roles: **Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master & Scrum Team (Development Team).**

#### Planning

Happens before the start of every project. The Scrum Master will be organizing with the devs each Sprint and which Scrum Team Dev is going to be responsible for what part(s).

#### Sprints

The cycles are called **Sprints**, and those will represent a period of **2 - 4 weeks** each.

The Sprints objectives will be defined by the PO, and their order will be kept in a list called the **Product Backlog.**

Before each Sprint, there is a **Sprint Planning Meet** where the **Sprint Backlog (Objectives)** will be defined.

---

#### Daily Meetings

Team DMs are done quickly. There are 2 ways to do them.

**First: People Centric**

- What have you done yesterday?
- What are you doing today?
- Is there a challenge in your way? Can anybody help?

**Second: Work Centric**

There is an analysis process of the **Sprint Backlog**, and the team is **aligned** with the daily demands.

The Scrum Master will act as a "leader" in the **DMs** and also update the **Sprint Backlog status** and also 

#### Sprint Retro Meeting

Finally there is a **final meeting** after the Sprint to clarify **pros and cons** for the next Sprint to start.

## Kanban

A Kanban Board is a visual representation of the progress of all activities, such as **Scrum Sprints & Backlogs.** It is done basically to organize and prevent unecessary discussions in development.
