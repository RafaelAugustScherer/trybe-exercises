Docker is a **clever solution** for repeated virtualized machines to run processes that take up a lot of space and require high processing power. Docker does that with an **optimized build** of the OS leaving just the **absolute necessary** for the processes to work.

# Installation

Follow the installation process in the official Docker Website: [https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Donâ€™t forget the pre-requisites!
